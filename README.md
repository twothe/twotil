# A collection of lightweight utility functions designed to simplify a programmer's life.

Sometimes you have to write the same code over and over, but then you don't want to. That's why smart people invented a thing called a library. 
This is one of them. It is not big, but therefore also has no dependencies and is really fast. Because I like code that is small, fast and easily portable.

Maybe you also want to use this library, then feel free to do so. Apache 2.0 license grants free permission for most cases.

Updates will happen when needed or requested, core functionality should not change (as it would break all my stuff as well). 
Library is intentionally at Java 1.8, because sadly many companies can't seem to find the time to update their code.
